# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/);
each PR bumps the version.

## 0.4.0

### Changed

- **Standardized the vocabulary.** The toolkit makes two animations — a **Burst** and a
  **Merger** — and combines them into a **Moment**. Renamed the registered animations,
  modes, files (`burst.ts` / `merger.ts` / `moment.ts`), dial scopes, exports
  (`burst.html` / `merger.html` / `moment.html`) and all UI/docs to match. (Deep internals
  — the `osp-creation` / `osp-splash` CSS classes and `cr*` / `sp*` dial keys — stay as
  implementation detail; see the roadmap.)
- **Three windows, fixed roles, one row:** left **Burst**, middle **Moment** (the two
  combined), right **Merger**.

### Added

- **Swap order** — reverses the two animations in the Moment (the middle plays
  Merger→Burst) and swaps the side windows.
- **Continue the chain** — folds the current Moment into a new one: the current Moment
  becomes the saved left window, a new **randomized** Moment (perturbed from the current
  dials) becomes the right window, and the middle plays them combined. Repeatable (depth
  capped so the loop stays watchable). Deep-linkable via `?swap=1` / `?chain=<n>`.
- The showcase now **conducts** all three windows (one sequence player drives the Swap
  reversal and the chain), via a clearable `window.__ospLoop` handle on the export loop.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **20 new tunable parameters** (29 total) wired to real effects — creation: core/flash
  sizes, ray length/width, ring thickness/expand, hue, brightness, test-pattern band;
  splash: orb/horizon/disk sizes, shock/streak/plume/flash sizes, hue, and canvas dust
  count/size/spiral. All default to today's look (CSS `var()` fallbacks).
- **10 presets** (`presets.json`), `Original` as the default, surfaced as a dropdown in the
  showcase and the lab.
- **Single source for dials** — `src/intro/dials.json` (defaults + UI schema + `scope`).
  `introTimeline.ts` derives `INTRO_DIALS`/`INTRO_SCHEMA`; `creation`/`splash` project their
  dials by `scope` via `pickByScope()`. The keystone from `IMPROVEMENTS.md` §0.1.

### Changed

- **The showcase is data-driven** — it `fetch`es `dials.json` + `presets.json` and builds
  its controls from them (the hand-copied panel literal is gone), with a **compact,
  grouped two-column dial UI** and the **three windows pinned to one row**.
- Dial labels/inputs are now associated for accessibility (`label[for]` + `aria-label`);
  `applyDials` coerces values through `Number()` so a non-number can't be baked into the
  inline export script.
- A full pass over the code: see [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md) (this version lands
  §0.1, §0.2, §0.3 partial, §1.3, §2.4, §6.1/§6.2, §8.3/§8.4).

## 0.2.0

### Changed

- **The showcase now shows the moment of creation's own two halves.** The intro is two
  animations in sequence — the **creation burst** and the **binary-merger splash**. The
  engine now registers each half plus the whole as three animations driven from one
  overlay via `window.__ospMode` (`creation` / `splash` / `full`) — no duplicated markup.
  The Pages showcase shows the two halves looping separately and the original intro
  together (three windows), with a knob panel per half whose dials drive the matching
  windows live.

### Removed

- The **Lissajous** animation (an unrelated "does the engine generalize?" demo). Parked,
  not gone — see [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md); the code is in git history.

### Added

- [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md) — a running, prioritized list of code and
  architecture improvements from a full pass over the repo.
- `Animation.mode` + a mode dispatcher in the intro overlay so one overlay can play
  several ways.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- **GitHub Pages was blank.** Pages deploys from the repo root, where it served the Vite
  first-paint _demo_ `index.html` — which needs a build step, so static-served it threw
  `window.__ospDials is undefined`. The repo root is now the static, build-free site: the
  showcase is `index.html` with the single-file exports (`intro.html`, `lissajous.html`)
  beside it and a root `.nojekyll`. The Vite first-paint demo moved to `demo.html` (now the
  Vite build entry), and it guards on `window.__ospDials` so it can't throw if served raw.

## 0.1.0

Initial release — the animation engine.

- Extracted the **moment-of-creation** intro from One Still Point with its commit history.
- Build scaffold (Vite + TypeScript + Vitest) so it runs standalone.
- Generalized into a multi-animation **engine**: animations as registered data, a per-animation
  dial schema, a second animation (**Lissajous**), a general tuning **lab**, and a
  **single-file export** (`npm run export`).
- A **GitHub Pages showcase**: the intro and the Lissajous looping separately and composited
  together, with live knob panels for every dial.
